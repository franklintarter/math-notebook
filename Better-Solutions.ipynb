    "# Better Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to move beyond brute force and find a better solution. How do we go about finding it? When discovering or inventing anything new there is no absolute path by definition. But there are tools available to spark ideas for new solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply tools from other problems\n",
    "- Look for patterns\n",
    "- Look for simplifications\n",
    "- Draw a visual representation of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll try knowledge from other problems, patterns, and simplifications. We'll do some visualizations in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools From Other Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current solution involves doing sums over and over. Most of us have done sums in our day and have a few tools to make sums easier. Do you have any tricks to make this sum easier to do in your head?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "56 + 70 + 30 + 44\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem too obvious to be a tool but we know that we can change the order of the sums and still get the correct answer. If we change the order we can sum numbers that end in a nice round number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "55 + 44 + 70 + 30 = 100 + 100 = 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pairs of sums add up to the same number we could even think of multiplication rather than adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100 + 100 = 2 * 100 = 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not obvious yet how these tools will help with consecutive sums. But by revisiting our sums tools we're primed to notice something interesting about consecutive sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, try to apply the sums tools on the consecutive sum of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If nothing jumped out try again with the consecutive sum of 9, or 11. See if anything else jumps out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Look for Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply the sums tools with consecutive sums and look for patterns in the process and the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the consecutive sum of 9 let's group pairs of sums that end up in a round number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 =\n",
    "(1 + 9) + (2 + 8) (3 + 7) (4 + 6) + 5 =\n",
    "45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We get 4 pairs that add up to 10 and then a lone 5 left over. We can see that there's a pattern of pairing the smallest and largest, the next smallest and next largest. Let's try it with 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not as obvious how to pair the numbers simply. We could pair 1 through 9 the same way as before and then add 10 and 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1 + 9) + (2 + 8) (3 + 7) (4 + 6) + 5 + 10 + 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sum is still pretty easy to do but if we try to make the pairs of sums be 10 it won't work very well different scenarios. What if we don't worry about summing the pairs to the easiest sum but instead focus on the pattern we found with consecutive sum of 9. We always pair the smallest and largest and go from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 =\n",
    "(1 + 11) + (2 + 10) + (3 + 9) + (4 + 8) + (5 + 6) + 7 =\n",
    "12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 7 =\n",
    "67\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying that pattern is what gives us the biggest breakthrough so far. When we pair the smalleset and greatest numbers we always get the same sum. It doesn't matter that much that it's not a nice round number like 10. If they're always the same number we can turn it into multiplication. The value of the first pair multiplied by the number of pairs + the left over.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value_of_first_pair * number_of_pairs + leftover\n",
    "12 * 5 + 7 = 67\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it one more time with 10 being the final number of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 =\n",
    "(1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) =\n",
    "11 * 5 + 0 =\n",
    "55\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We had no left over number after we paired the other numbers. This makes sense because 10 is an even number. This is another pattern. For 9 and 11 we had a left over number, both being odd. To describe this pattern as a rule: when the final number is odd the middle number will be the left over.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern recognition has improved our procedure by a lot, but there are still some hard parts, especially as we work with bigger sequences. Here are the parts that still take work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting the pairs\n",
    "- Dealing with the left over if it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to simplify counting pairs. Can we determine how many pairs we'll have just by looking at the largest number?"
