    "# Better Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to move beyond brute force and find a better solution. How do we go about finding it? When discovering or inventing anything new there is no absolute path by definition. But there are tools available to spark ideas for new solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply tools from other problems\n",
    "- Look for patterns\n",
    "- Look for simplifications\n",
    "- Draw a visual representation of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try knowledge from other problems, patterns, and simplifications. We'll do some visualizations in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools From Other Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current solution involves doing sums over and over. Most of us have done sums in our day and have a few tools to make sums easier. Do you have any tricks to make this sum easier to do in your head?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "56 + 70 + 30 + 44\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem too obvious to be a tool but we know that we can change the order of the sums and still get the correct answer. If we change the order we can sum numbers that end in a nice round number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "55 + 44 + 70 + 30 = 100 + 100 = 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pairs of sums add up to the same number we could even think of multiplication rather than adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "100 + 100 = 2 * 100 = 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not obvious yet how these tools will help with consecutive sums. But by revisiting our sums tools we're primed to notice something interesting about consecutive sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, try to apply the sums tools on the consecutive sum of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If nothing jumped out try again with the consecutive sum of 9, or 11. See if anything else jumps out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Look for Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply the sums tools with consecutive sums and look for patterns in the process and the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the consecutive sum of 9 let's group pairs of sums that add up to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 =\n",
    "(1 + 9) + (2 + 8) (3 + 7) (4 + 6) + 5 =\n",
    "45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We get 4 pairs that add up to 10 and then a lone 5 leftover. We can see that there's a pattern of pairing the smallest and largest, the next smallest and next largest. Let's try it with 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not as obvious how to pair the numbers simply. We could pair 1 through 9 the same way as before and then add 10 and 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1 + 9) + (2 + 8) (3 + 7) (4 + 6) + 5 + 10 + 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sum is still pretty easy to do but if we try to make the pairs of sums be 10 it won't work very in different scenarios. What if we don't worry about summing the pairs to the easiest sum but instead focus on the pattern we found with consecutive sum of 9. We always pair the smallest and largest and go from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 =\n",
    "(1 + 11) + (2 + 10) + (3 + 9) + (4 + 8) + (5 + 7) + 6 =\n",
    "12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 6 =\n",
    "66\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying that pattern is what gives us the biggest breakthrough so far. When we pair the smallest and greatest numbers we always get the same sum. It doesn't matter that much that it's not a nice round number like 10. If they're always the same number we can turn it into multiplication. The value of the first pair multiplied by the number of pairs + the leftover.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value_of_first_pair * number_of_pairs + leftover\n",
    "12 * 5 + 6 = 66\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it one more time with 10 being the final number of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 =\n",
    "(1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) =\n",
    "11 * 5 + 0 =\n",
    "55\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We had no leftover number after we paired the other numbers. This makes sense because 10 is an even number. This is another pattern. For 9 and 11 we had a leftover number, both being odd. To describe this pattern as a rule: when the final number is odd the middle number will be the leftover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern recognition has improved our procedure by a lot, but there are still some hard parts. The hard parts will get harder when the sequence gets longer. Here are the hard parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Value of first pair\n",
    "- Counting the pairs\n",
    "- Dealing with the leftover if it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is the easiest to simplify. What's the simplest way to express the value of the first pair? We've already said it's the sum of the smallest and largest number. The largest number will always be **n**. The smallest number will always be 1. So we can define it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value_of_first_pair = n + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to simplify counting pairs. Can we determine how many pairs we'll have just by looking at the largest number? Yes, the largest number is also the same as the number of numbers in the sequence. A sequence with 10 numbers will have 5 pairs. We can find the number of pairs by dividing the largest number by 2. If **n** is the largest number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "number_of_pairs = n / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice if **n** is odd the number of pairs will be something and a half. For **n = 11** the **number_of_pairs** will be 5.5. This dovetails nicely into the second simplification we need – dealing with the leftover.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense for the half pair to be represented by 0.5. So our **n / 2** is valid for finding out if there's a leftover pair. As a programmer, I'm (wrongly) tempted to handle this situation with a logical step. I.E. \"If number_of_pairs has a remainder, add a number equal to the middle number\". But if we settle on that we'd miss out on another simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at our earlier examples where we had remainders. **n = 9** and **n = 11**. Note, we'll be using our simplified formula. Let's also do 13 and 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value_of_first_pair * number_of_pairs + leftover\n",
    "\n",
    "consecutive_sum(9) = 10 * 5 + 5\n",
    "consecutive_sum(11) = 12 * 6 + 6\n",
    "consecutive_sum(13) = 14 * 7 + 7\n",
    "consecutive_sum(15) = 16 * 8 + 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a pattern related to the leftover screaming at us. The leftover is the same as the **number_of_pairs**. It's also half of the **value_of_first_pair**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have an extra 0.5 pair (when **n** is odd) it will get multiplied by **value_of_first_pair**. The `0.5 * value_of_first_pair` is the value of the middle number!\n",
    "\n",
    "When there's no extra 0.5 pair (when **n** is even) we are just multiplying pairs. There's no middle number added to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works whether the leftover exists or not. The \"sometimes half pair\" is not a condition to deal with, it is a correct expression that deals with the concept of \"half a pair when it exists\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting It Together\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used tools from other problems, looking for patterns, and simplification. We've gained a bunch of insight about this consecutive sum problem. Now it's time to create a better solution or a better procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first write it out in our verbose terms. As usual **n** is the final number in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "number_of_pairs = n / 2\n",
    "value_of_first_pair = n + 1\n",
    "consecutive_sum = number_of_pairs * value_of_first_pair\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Python code is basically going to write itself with those terms defined so clearly."
