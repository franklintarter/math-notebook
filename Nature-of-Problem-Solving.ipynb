    "# The Nature of Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us shudder when thinking about doing math problems. We remember memorizing formulas and applying them rotely. All for the purpose of passing a test, following a procedure, getting the right answer. It feels dry, sterile\n",
    "\n",
    "If this our memory of the nature of problem solving then we need to unlearn it. There is something better. The true nature of problem solving involves creativity, joy and beauty. It grants powerful tools that help us understand nature. It gives us an escape hatch from the whims of nature that are often harsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is an attempt to fix our experience with problem solving and reveal its true nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This series will use basic programming, visuals and math to understand a single problem in depth. From this deep dive we will see that we can mine many tools, intuitions, and ideas from one simple problem."

    "With a small *n* we can solve this naively by starting on the left and keeping a running total as we sum all the numbers to the right. If we can recognize that simple procedure, we can get the right answer on the test. But remember we are remaking our idea of problem solving. We don't really care about getting the right answer by following a procedure. We are to become inventors of procedures.\n",
