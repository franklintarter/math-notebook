    "Our only term will be *n* where *n* is the largest number in the sequence. In our first two examples *n* was *10* and *7* respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In procedure we first find the sum of the largest and smallest number. The largest number is itself *n* and the smallest number is *1*. So the factor of the pairs can be expressed as `n + 1`.\n",

    "Next, find the number of pairs. Rather than counting how many pairs there are we can divide *n* by two. The number of pairs is `n / 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the sum of pairs and the number of pairs, we multiply them to get the result. This is our complete formula.\n",
    "\n",

    "`(5)(11)`\n",
    "`55`\n",

    "We can see formula broken down into the same steps as the procedure but without the counting. This is a good sign. Let's test the other example where `n = 7`.\n",

    "`(3.5)(8)`\n",
    "`28`\n",
    "\n",
    "We got the correct result. The only difference in steps is that the number without a pair is represented by the `0.5` in the `3.5`. We could've taken an additional step and factored the `0.5` out to get `(3)(8) + 4`. But representing the non-paired number as `0.5` feels intuitive enough.\n",

    "Let's define our Gauss equation in code. We'll make it very verbose."
